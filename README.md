## How to Use

### Requirements

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) needs to be running to build the outputs ‚Äî I don't want to bother with LaTex dependencies.

### Building the PDFs

Use the provided script as a wrapper around `make`, it will execute with the relevant Docker container:

```bash
./make.sh
```

It uses a fully blown LaTex setup so the image is pretty hefty (~2GB).
