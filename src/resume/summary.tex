Current Engineering Manager at \href{https://allegro.pl}{\underline{Allegro}}, Poland's biggest e-commerce platform.

Over 12 years of well-rounded commercial experience, specializing in backend engineering with hands-on experience in front-end development, infrastructure, and management.
I deeply care about people and their problems and believe that a software engineer should be able to empathise across the board â€” end user or teammate alike.
My main focus is creating genuine value and I see software as a means to do that, so I'm happy to learn any technology that's required to get the job done.
