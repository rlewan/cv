Current Lead Software Engineer at EdTech startup Boclips.
11+ years of commercial presence specializing in backend engineering, with hands-on frontends and infrastructure experience.
I deeply care about people and their problems and believe that a software engineer should be able to empathise across the board â€” end user or teammate alike.
My main focus is creating value and I see software as a means to do that, so I'm happy to learn any new technology that's required to get the job done.
