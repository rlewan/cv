          \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
            \item {Being a lead engineer at Boclips meant I had to tend to the flow of information between product, design, engineering and the business, ultimately providing a clear direction for the team. Entrusting the engineers with freedom to collectively choose tools and look after code quality helped to keep the morale high, but I also made sure that people get to spend quality work time in person as well (e.g. I got to organise and facilitate a team offsite at the end of 2022).}
            \item {Due to an unexpected vacancy in the product management role I acted as the team's PM for around a year. During that time we've managed to successfully design, build and release an updated version of Boclips' B2B website.}
            \item {As a lead I also took on people management duties, meaning I was responsible for running regular 1o1 meetings, coaching, collecting feedback and delivering performance reviews for my reports, including negotiating and advocating for salary adjustments.}
